# 📱 Mobile Setup & Testing Guide

Your RpgBalancer is built with responsive web technologies, meaning it works great on mobile devices right out of the box!

2. **Copy the URL** (e.g., `https://rpg-balancer.vercel.app`).
3. **Open** it in Chrome (Android) or Safari (iOS).

## "App-Like" Experience (PWA Style)
You can install the website as an app on your home screen to remove the browser bar and give it a native feel.

1. Open the URL in Safari.
2. Tap the **Share** button (square with arrow up).
3. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**.
4. Name it "RpgBalancer" and tap **Add**.

### Android (Chrome)
1. Open the URL in Chrome.
2. Tap the **Menu** (three dots).
3. Tap **"Add to Home screen"** or **"Install App"**.
4. Confirm by tapping **Add**.

## Mobile Features
