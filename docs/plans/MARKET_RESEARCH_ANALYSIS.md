# Market Research & Monetization Analysis: Idle Village RPG

**Date:** December 12, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Context:** Solo Dev, Mobile-First (PWA/Hybrid) + PC (Steam), Idle Incremental RPG with "Village" meta.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The "Idle Village" concept sits at the intersection of **Idle RPG** (fastest growing RPG sub-genre) and **Simulation** (village management). 

- **Opportunity:** Idle RPGs now account for **16% of mobile RPG revenue** (up from 1.7% in 2020). Players are looking for depth without the time commitment of MMORPGs.
- **Unique Selling Point (USP):** The "Lose to Progress" loop + "Founder/Village" dynamic offers a narrative depth often missing in generic "number go up" clones.
- **Monetization Fit:** The proposed **€5 Entry Pack + Whale Scaling** model is industry-standard for high-performing indies (e.g., *Melvor Idle*, *Frozen City*) and aligns well with the "buy-to-remove-friction" preference of Western PC/Mobile gamers.
- **Realistic Year 1 Revenue:** **€25k - €60k** (Scenario: Realistic). This requires a successful Steam Next Fest (Tier 2 result) and decent mobile retention (D1 > 35%).

## 2. Market Overview & Trends

### 2.1 The Rise of "Idle"
- **Mobile:** Idle games have evolved from simple clickers to complex "Idle RPGs" (*AFK Journey*, *Legend of Mushroom*).
- **PC/Steam:** A distinct "Premium Idle" niche exists (*Melvor Idle*, *Loop Hero*, *Rusty's Retirement*). These players appreciate "respectful" monetization (one-time purchases) over aggressive gacha.
- **Demographics:**
  - **Age:** ~32 years old average (younger than MMORPGs).
  - **Session:** Short & frequent (~5 sessions/day, ~10 mins each) on mobile; Background/Second-monitor play on PC.

### 2.2 Key Competitors & Comparables

| Game | Platform | Model | Relevance | Key Lesson |
|------|----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| **AFK Journey** | Mobile | F2P + Gacha | High-End | Visuals & "Seasons" drive long-term retention. |
| **Legend of Mushroom** | Mobile | F2P + Ads | Casual | Massive ad-revenue potential, but high CPI. |
| **Frozen City** | Mobile | Hybrid | Survival Sim | "Starving" mechanics monetize well via "Desperation Packs". |
| **Melvor Idle** | PC/Mobile | Premium/F2P | Hardcore | Cross-platform sync + "Demo is F2P, Full is Paid" works well. |
| **Darkest Dungeon** | PC/Console | Premium | Aesthetic | "Lose to Progress" & Stress mechanics (high overlapping vibe). |
| **Punch Club** | PC/Mobile | Premium | Management | Daily loops & stat decay create urgency (your inspiration). |

## 3. Benchmarks & Targets

Benchmarks are based on 2024 industry reports (GameAnalytics, Sensor Tower, MAF) for the **RPG / Simulation** genres.

### 3.1 Retention (Critical for Success)
| Metric | Industry Avg | Top 25% (Target) | Notes |
|--------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| **D1** | 26-28% | **35-40%** | The "First 10 Minutes" must be perfect. |
| **D7** | ~8% | **12-15%** | Defines your core engaged audience. |
| **D30** | <3% | **5-7%** | Driven by meta-progression & seasonal content. |

### 3.2 Monetization
| Metric | Benchmark | Project Target |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Conversion (Payer %)** | 1-2% | **2-3%** (Higher due to €5 low barrier) |
| **ARPPU (Daily)** | $50-60 | **€15-20** (Lower due to reliance on small packs vs massive gacha) |
| **ARPDAU** | $0.05-0.10 | **€0.08-0.12** |

## 4. Monetization Strategy: "The Fair & The Whale"

### 4.1 The €5 "Founder's Charter" (Remove Annoyance)
Designed to convert the "D7 Engaged" player. It should feel like "unlocking the full game".
* **Price:** €4.99 - €5.99
* **Contents:**
  * **Remove Ads:** (If ads exist).
  * **Automation:** Auto-assign workers to last job on new day.
  * **Speed:** 2x Game Speed toggle.
  * **Efficiency:** Queue multiple actions (if activity queue is a mechanic).
  * **Cosmetic:** "Founder" badge in leaderboards.

### 4.2 The Whale Economy (Uncapped Spending)
Whales need meaningful things to buy that don't trivialize the PvE challenge for others.
* **Gacha/Recruitment:** Rare Heroes (Essential if using the "Founder + Mediocre Village" pillar). Whales chase the 1% founder stats.
* **Time Warps:** "Skip 4 Hours" / "Instant Finish Job". High value because V1 has *no offline progress*.
* **Resurrection/Safety:** "Phoenix Feather" to save a high-level founder from permadeath. High emotional value.
* **Seasons/Battle Pass:** Monthly track with resources + exclusive skins.

### 4.3 Ad Strategy (Optional but Recommended)
* **Reward Video ONLY:** Never forced interstitials.
* **Uses:** "Watch to reroll Tavern recruits", "Watch to speed up current job by 30m".

## 6. Actionable Recommendations

### Positioning & Design
1.  **"Darkest Dungeon meets Cookie Clicker":** Lean into the "Manage, Suffer, Rebuild" loop in marketing. It distinguishes you from generic idle games.
2.  **The "Active Idle" Problem:** Since V1 has *no offline progress*, you **must** make the active window satisfying. Consider a "Battery Saver" mode (black screen, low FPS) so players can leave it running on phones/desktops without guilt.
3.  **Telegraph Death:** Permadeath drives monetization (Resurrection items), but it *must* be fair. Give players "Escape Chance" indicators.

### Monetization
4.  **The "Welcome Bundle" Trap:** Don't show the €5 pack on Day 1. Let them play. Show it on **Day 3** or after their first "close call".
5.  **Seasonal Servers:** If you want whales to stay, reset the leaderboards every 3-4 months (keep cosmetics/account progress). New servers = New whale races.

### Marketing & Launch
6.  **Steam Next Fest is Critical:**
    *   **Demo:** Must be polished. 30-60 mins of gameplay.
    *   **Timing:** Launch demo 2 months *before* Next Fest to gather feedback.
    *   **Livestream:** Loop a pre-recorded dev-playthrough on your Steam page during the Fest.
7.  **Itch.io First:** Release an Alpha on Itch.io. It's a forgiving community for "vibe coding" tests.
8.  **TikTok/Shorts:** "Idle Village" visuals (lots of tiny people working/fighting) are satisfying. Post "Anthill" style videos.

### Career & Reputation
9.  **Build in Public:** Share your "Config-Driven" architecture on Twitter/Reddit/Dev.to. It establishes you as a *technical* expert, not just a game dev.
10. **Reuse Your Tech:** The "RPG Balancer" + "Idle Engine" is a platform. Game #2 should take 50% less time.
