# Market Research & Monetization Analysis: Idle Incremental RPG

**Date:** December 12, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Context:** Solo dev, Steam-first (desktop) with Mobile/PWA as extension/long-tail, Idle Incremental RPG with "Village" meta.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The "Idle Incremental RPG" concept sits at the intersection of **Idle RPG** (fastest growing RPG sub-genre) and **Simulation** (village management).

- **Opportunity:** Idle RPGs now account for **16% of mobile RPG revenue** (up from 1.7% in 2020). Players are looking for depth without the time commitment of MMORPGs.
- **Positioning:** Treat the *Idle Incremental RPG* as **Steam-first (desktop) with Mobile/PWA as extension/long-tail**. Early marketing, FTUE tuning and quality targets are optimised for a strong **PC demo + Next Fest**, while keeping the UX/mobile layout friendly enough for later mobile reach.
- **Unique Selling Point (USP):** The "Lose to Progress" loop + "Founder/Village" dynamic offers a narrative depth often missing in generic "number go up" clones.
- **Monetization Fit:** The proposed **€5 Entry Pack + Whale Scaling** model is industry-standard for high-performing indies (e.g., *Melvor Idle*, *Frozen City*) and aligns well with the "buy-to-remove-friction" preference of Western PC/Mobile gamers.
- **Realistic Year 1 Revenue ("Solid" Scenario):** **€25k - €60k** assuming a successful Steam Next Fest (Tier 2 result) and decent mobile retention (D1 > 35%).
- **Lifecycle framing:** Very roughly, an indie game like this can expect **Lifetime Revenue ≈ 2–3× Year 1** if it keeps a stable player base with light updates; that puts this "Solid" scenario in the ballpark of **€50k–150k lifetime**, with very high uncertainty.

## 2. Market Overview & Trends

### 2.1 The Rise of "Idle"
- **Mobile:** Idle games have evolved from simple clickers to complex "Idle RPGs" (*AFK Journey*, *Legend of Mushroom*).
- **PC/Steam:** A distinct "Premium Idle" niche exists (*Melvor Idle*, *Loop Hero*, *Rusty's Retirement*). These players appreciate "respectful" monetization (one-time purchases) over aggressive gacha.
- **Demographics:**
  - **Age:** ~32 years old average (younger than MMORPGs).
  - **Session:** Short & frequent (~5 sessions/day, ~10 mins each) on mobile; Background/Second-monitor play on PC.

### 2.2 Key Competitors & Comparables

| Game | Platform | Model | Relevance | Key Lesson |
|------|----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| **AFK Journey** | Mobile | F2P + Gacha | High-End | Visuals & "Seasons" drive long-term retention. |
| **Legend of Mushroom** | Mobile | F2P + Ads | Casual | Massive ad-revenue potential, but high CPI. |
| **Frozen City** | Mobile | Hybrid | Survival Sim | "Starving" mechanics monetize well via "Desperation Packs". |
| **Melvor Idle** | PC/Mobile | Premium/F2P | Hardcore | Cross-platform sync + "Demo is F2P, Full is Paid" works well. |
| **Darkest Dungeon** | PC/Console | Premium | Aesthetic | "Lose to Progress" & Stress mechanics (high overlapping vibe). |
| **Punch Club** | PC/Mobile | Premium | Management | Daily loops & stat decay create urgency (your inspiration). |

## 3. Benchmarks & Targets

Benchmarks are based on 2024 industry reports (GameAnalytics, Sensor Tower, MAF) for the **RPG / Simulation** genres.

### 3.1 Retention (Critical for Success)
| Metric | Industry Avg | Top 25% (Target) | Notes |
|--------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| **D1** | 26-28% | **35-40%** | The "First 10 Minutes" must be perfect. |
| **D7** | ~8% | **12-15%** | Defines your core engaged audience. |
| **D30** | <3% | **5-7%** | Driven by meta-progression & seasonal content. |

### 3.2 Monetization
| Metric | Benchmark (RPG / Strategy / Idle) | Project Target |
|--------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| **Conversion (Payer %)** | 1-2% average, 2-5% for well-performing fair F2P | **2-3%** on the €5 pack (with upside to 4-5% if FTUE + offer are very strong) |
| **ARPPU (Lifetime / paying user)** | $5-15 for fair mid-core/idle (can spike much higher in gacha-heavy titles) | **€5-10** (mainly €5 pack + occasional extras) |
| **ARPDAU** | $0.03-0.10 for healthy titles | **€0.03-0.08** (fair, non-gacha, pack-first model) |

### 3.3 Steam Benchmarks (Wishlist, Conversion, Pricing)

Recent GameDiscoverCo macro-analyses (2024–2025) of hundreds of Steam releases with at least ~5k launch wishlists show:

- **Wishlist → first-month sales:**
  - Median "wishlist balance to Week 1 sales" ratio ≈ **10–11%**.
  - Well-positioned niche games (good fit + strong demo/marketing) can reach **20–30%** conversion at/around launch.
- **Long-tail revenue:**
  - For most indie titles, **Year 1 revenue ≈ 2–3×** first-month revenue (sales, discounts, long-tail discovery).
- **Pricing ranges for comparable games:**
  - Many **small/compact idle or overlay sims** (e.g. desktop idlers) price in the **single digits** (≈ $5–10).
  - Deeper, long-form **idle / incremental RPGs** with lots of systems (closer to Melvor-style depth) tend towards **low-teens** pricing (≈ $10–15).

**Implications for Idle Incremental RPG (provisional):**

- **Wishlist → sales planning:**
  - Treat ~**10%** wl→sales as a **baseline** expectation.
  - Consider **20–25%** wl→sales as an **ambitious but realistic upper bound** if demo + Steam page + Next Fest go well.
- **Year 1 Steam revenue:**
  - Estimate **Year 1 = 2–3× launch month** when doing high-level scenarios.
- **Price band:**
  - Early Access / 1.0 could reasonably sit in the **€9.99–€14.99** range, depending on perceived depth and content at launch.
  - Discounts and regional pricing will be essential; the headline price is mostly a signal of positioning.

## 4. Monetization Strategy: "The Fair & The Whale"

### 4.1 The €5 "Founder's Charter" (Remove Annoyance)
Designed to convert the "D7 Engaged" player. It should feel like "unlocking the full game".
* **Price:** €4.99 - €5.99
* **Contents:**
  * **Remove Ads:** (If ads exist).
  * **Automation:** Auto-assign workers to last job on new day.
  * **Speed:** 2x Game Speed toggle.
  * **Efficiency:** Queue multiple actions (if activity queue is a mechanic).
  * **Cosmetic:** "Founder" badge in leaderboards.

### 4.2 The Whale Economy (Uncapped Spending)
Whales need meaningful things to buy that don't trivialize the PvE challenge for others.
* **Gacha/Recruitment:** Rare Heroes (Essential if using the "Founder + Mediocre Village" pillar). Whales chase the 1% founder stats.
* **Time Warps:** "Skip 4 Hours" / "Instant Finish Job". High value because V1 has *no offline progress*.
* **Resurrection/Safety:** "Phoenix Feather" to save a high-level founder from permadeath. High emotional value.
* **Seasons/Battle Pass:** Monthly track with resources + exclusive skins.

### 4.3 Ad Strategy (Optional but Recommended)
* **Reward Video ONLY:** Never forced interstitials.
* **Uses:** "Watch to reroll Tavern recruits", "Watch to speed up current job by 30m".

## 5. Revenue Scenarios (Year 1)

*Assumptions: Mobile + Steam launch. Marketing budget ~€3k. Solo dev.*

### 🌑 Pessimistic (The "Quiet" Launch)
* **Installs:** 15k
* **Metrics:** D1 25%, Conv 1.5%
* **Outcome:** ~€400-600/month post-launch.
* **Year 1 Total:** **€5k - €8k**
* *Verdict:* Covers server costs + coffee. Typical for first-time indies without community.

### 🌓 Realistic (The "Solid" Launch)
* **Installs:** 40k (Steam Next Fest Tier 2 success + organic)
* **Metrics:** D1 35%, Conv 2.5%
* **Outcome:** ~€2k-3k/month avg.
* **Year 1 Total:** **€25k - €50k**
* *Verdict:* Sustainable side-income. Builds strong reputation.

### 🌕 Optimistic (The "Viral" Hit)
* **Installs:** 100k+ (Streamer pickup, "Tier 3" Next Fest)
* **Metrics:** D1 45%, Conv 3%+, strong Whale hook.
* **Outcome:** ~€10k+/month.
* **Year 1 Total:** **€150k+**
* *Verdict:* Career-changing. Requires "Lightning in a bottle" (Game Hook must be incredibly meme-able or satisfying).

### 5.4 Scenario Probabilities (Very Rough)

These are **back-of-the-envelope probabilities** for Year 1, assuming:

- Phase 1 dell'*Idle Incremental RPG* arriva a una vertical slice decente, FTUE ok.
- ~**€2k** spesi bene in asset (art/trailer) + un minimo di marketing mirato (non UA massiva).

| Bucket (questo doc) | Nome colloquiale | Year 1 totale (ordine di grandezza) | Probabilità stimata | Split Year 1 Steam / Mobile |
|---------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| **Scarso**          | Quiet / quasi flop | ~**€0–10k** (ancorato al caso pessimistico €5–8k) | ≈ **45%** | ≈ **70% Steam / 30% Mobile** |
| **Medio**           | "Esiste ma non svolta" | ~**€10–25k** | ≈ **35%** | ≈ **70% Steam / 30% Mobile** |
| **Solido**          | Realistic – "Solid" | ~**€25–60k** (scenario centrale del doc) | ≈ **18%** | ≈ **70–80% Steam / 20–30% Mobile** |
| **Hit**             | Viral Hit          | **€150k+** | ≈ **2%** | ≈ **60% Steam / 40% Mobile** |

Nota: dentro il bucket **Scarso**, solo una porzione dei casi (roughly **10–20%** di tutti i percorsi possibili) porta a ricavi **< €2k** Year 1 (cioè non rientrare dei ~2k€ investiti). Gli altri casi scarsi rientrano a malapena o superano di poco il break-even ma restano ben sotto lo scenario "Medio".

## 6. Actionable Recommendations

### Positioning & Design
1.  **"Darkest Dungeon meets Cookie Clicker":** Lean into the "Manage, Suffer, Rebuild" loop in marketing. It distinguishes you from generic idle games.
2.  **The "Active Idle" Problem:** Since V1 has *no offline progress*, you **must** make the active window satisfying. Consider a "Battery Saver" mode (black screen, low FPS) so players can leave it running on phones/desktops without guilt.
3.  **Telegraph Death:** Permadeath drives monetization (Resurrection items), but it *must* be fair. Give players "Escape Chance" indicators.

### Monetization
4.  **The "Welcome Bundle" Trap:** Don't show the €5 pack on Day 1. Let them play. Show it on **Day 3** or after their first "close call".
5.  **Seasonal Servers:** If you want whales to stay, reset the leaderboards every 3-4 months (keep cosmetics/account progress). New servers = New whale races.

#### Steam Pricing (Desktop-first)

For the **Steam PC version** (desktop-first, no offline progress, idle/management niche), the current working assumption is:

- **Initial target price:** **€9.99**
  - Matches a scope where Idle Incremental RPG offers:
    - A strong core loop (village management + idle autobattler) with ~10–30 hours of meaningful play for most players.
    - A clear but not massive meta-progression layer (1–2 main upgrade trees), without promising dozens of biomes/modes.
    - A stylised but not AAA art direction, with good readability and coherent fantasy.
  - Fits the implicit player expectation of a **focused indie game with a strong idea**, some rough edges allowed.

- **When would ~€14.99 be justified?**
  - Significantly larger perceived scope:
    - 30–50+ hours of content for a typical player.
    - Multiple distinct zones/acts or modes that materially change gameplay.
    - Deeper meta (more upgrade trees, NG+/challenge modes) and/or narrative layers.
  - Higher production values (art, audio, UX) and a clearer commitment to **post-launch updates**.

Working decision for now: **design and position Idle Incremental RPG V1 around the €9.99 band on Steam**, with the option to revisit pricing (e.g. 11.99–14.99) only if scope and polish grow beyond the current Phase 12 plan.

### Marketing & Launch
6.  **Steam Next Fest is Critical:**
    *   **Demo:** Must be polished. 30-60 mins of gameplay.
    *   **Timing:** Launch demo 2 months *before* Next Fest to gather feedback.
    *   **Livestream:** Loop a pre-recorded dev-playthrough on your Steam page during the Fest.
7.  **Itch.io First:** Release an Alpha on Itch.io. It's a forgiving community for "vibe coding" tests.
8.  **TikTok/Shorts:** "Idle Incremental RPG" visuals (lots of tiny people working/fighting) are satisfying. Post "Anthill" style videos.
9.  **Events & Seasonal Content (Phase 2):** Treat weekly/monthly/holiday events as optional retention levers **after** the core loop and FTUE are stable. Design meta-systems so you can later plug in lightweight limited-time quests/modifiers without committing to a heavy live-ops calendar in V1.
10. **Publishing Roadmap (Desktop-first, Itch + Steam):**
    *   **Internal FTUE milestone (T-9 to T-6 months before any serious launch):**
        - Phase 12.1–12.5 playable end-to-end (run → meta → new run) in **30–60 minutes**.
        - Core loop stable, no crash/blocker bugs.
    *   **Itch.io Alpha (T-9/T-6):**
        - Public web build on Itch with clear **"alpha"** messaging.
        - Goal: **50–100 testers** to validate FTUE + messaging and gather qualitative feedback.
    *   **Steam "Coming Soon" page (T-6/T-4):**
        - Page live with capsule art + trailer; linked from Itch, X, README and docs.
        - Primary CTA: **wishlist**.
    *   **Steam demo + Next Fest (T-3/T-1):**
        - Demo aligned with the FTUE plan, stable and feature-locked.
        - Participate in one Steam Next Fest with a looping livestream (pre-recorded run is fine).
    *   **Release + post-launch (T0 and beyond):**
        - Early Access / 1.0 release on Steam.
        - 1–2 focused updates in the first 3 months, plus an optional **mobile/PWA soft launch** once the PC version is stable.

### Career & Reputation
9.  **Build in Public:** Share your "Config-Driven" architecture on Twitter/Reddit/Dev.to. It establishes you as a *technical* expert, not just a game dev.
10. **Reuse Your Tech:** The "RPG Balancer" + "Idle Engine" is a platform. Game #2 should take 50% less time.

## 7. Research Questions & Validation Plan

The goal of this section is to turn market/monetization uncertainty into a small set of explicit hypotheses with a concrete validation path.

| ID | Question | Why it matters | How to validate | When |
|----|----------|----------------|-----------------|------|
| Q1 | Is the €5 pack perceived as a fair **upgrade** and not a hard paywall? | This is the monetization backbone on mobile; if it feels mandatory, reviews and retention suffer. | Analyse 3-5 comparable "welcome packs" in fair idle/management games + 5-10 qualitative playtests with a mock store UI asking if/when they would buy. | After the first FTUE slice (0-60 minutes) is playable. |
| Q2 | How far beyond the €5 pack do players accept additional monetization (cosmetics, small QoL packs, DLC)? | Determines realistic ARPPU ceiling without damaging reputation. | Community polls, small surveys on itch/Steam/X + analysis of non-gacha idle/management monetization patterns. | Before locking the full IAP/DLC catalogue. |
| Q3 | Is Idle Village effectively **Steam-first with mobile as extension**, or **mobile-first with Steam as prestige window**? | Changes priorities: depth vs session length, UI density, and pricing expectations. | Compare performance of cross-platform idle/management games + observe device mix and behaviour in early web/itch demos. | As soon as early demo telemetry is available. |
| Q4 | Do PC/Steam players accept an idle game **without offline progress** if it is positioned as a "second-monitor management sim"? | This pillar can be a strong differentiator or a deal-breaker. | A/B test messaging ("no offline progress" framed positively) + collect explicit feedback from PC playtesters. | Before finalising Steam page copy and feature list. |
| Q5 | On mobile, how "active" can the idle loop be (no offline progress + time warps) before players feel it is too demanding? | Directly impacts D1/D7 retention and how aggressive time-based monetization can be without feeling pushy. | Soft-launch / alpha telemetry (session count & length) + post-session surveys about perceived effort and friction. | During first public mobile/itch tests. |
| Q6 | What is the ideal frequency of **death/collapse → new run** to feel meaningful but not exhausting? | Drives both emotional peaks (potential monetization moments) and long-term enjoyment. | Internal simulations (using the config-driven engine) to estimate average run length + targeted playtests asking explicitly about frustration vs excitement. | While tuning FTUE and early meta-progression. |
| Q7 | Do the "tiny workers / village" visuals have enough **thumbnail/short-form power** for X/TikTok/Shorts? | Determines how viable organic short-form content is as a primary discovery channel. | Produce 3-5 short clips (even with placeholder art), post across channels, and compare engagement at equal follower counts. | After a first visually coherent build exists. |
| Q8 | Is participating in a Steam Next Fest a net positive for Idle Village (given solo-dev time cost)? | Next Fest can be a huge multiplier or a distraction if the demo is not ready. | Study post-mortems of similar-scale idle/management games + use pre-SNF data (wishlists, demo traction) to estimate realistic upside. | Once the vertical slice and first wave of wishlists are in place. |
